A Go program that censors bad words scans a given text and replaces any predefined inappropriate or offensive words with symbols (such as * or #). It typically works by storing a list of banned words, reading user input or a text file, checking for matches (case-insensitive), and replacing those words while keeping the rest of the text unchanged. This program is useful for chat applications, forums, or content filters to maintain a clean and safe environment.
