A Go program that manages files by sorting them into different folders based on their extensions scans a given directory and automatically moves files into categorized folders. For example, .jpg and .png files go into an Images folder, .mp3 files go into Music, .mp4 into Videos, .txt or .pdf into Documents, etc. This program helps in organizing files, reducing clutter, and making it easier to find specific file types.
