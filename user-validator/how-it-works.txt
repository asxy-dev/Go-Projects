A Go program that checks whether a username is valid or not takes a username input from the user and verifies it based on certain rules, such as: it must not contain spaces, should only include letters, numbers, underscores, or dots, and must meet a specific length requirement (e.g., 4 characters). The program then displays whether the entered username is Valid or Invalid, making it useful for account registration systems or login validations.
